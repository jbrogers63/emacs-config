# Emacs Config
I just need a place to store my emacs configs.  That should make it easy to restore in the event of a failure. :)

### Installation
```bash
cd $HOME && git clone https://github.com/jbrogers63/emacs-config .emacs.d
```

### Notes
Note that the package-initialize call may not function properly on the first attempt to install all the packages.  It can be run manually for now.
